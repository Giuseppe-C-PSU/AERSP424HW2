If a new task was assigned as soon as the Ranger completes a task there might be a deadlock or some resource starvation going on. One of the other Rangers would probably pick up the
tools as soon as the first Ranger drops them, leaving the original Ranger unable to complete its task. A possible solution would be some kind of resource hierarchy like what was mentioned in the dining philosophers problem. It would make it so that instead of each Range picking up tools as soon as they are dropped the tools would go to the ones who have current tasks.
