An issuee I could run across while developing Q3 is not properly threading the tasks so the ATC can go through his list of actions while the planes are being created 
and deciding where to go. If the actions take too long
then it could effect the desicisons of the other planes
for example if a plane is taking too long to go through the traffic then other planes behind it could get diverted instead. 
If waking up the ATC takes too long it could delay the program. If checking the condition of the traffic pattern takes to long then it could result in actions based on incorrect data. As long as 
the threads are handeled properly this should all be minimized. Another solution could be to use less complex checks for each action.
